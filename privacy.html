                <li><strong>Friends feature (optional):</strong> If you choose to add friends, only your current streak count, total number of apps blocked, and last active time are uploaded to enable the friends leaderboard feature. This minimal data is only used to display your progress to friends you've connected with.</li>
                <li>We do not collect personal information such as your name, address, email, or any other identifying details.</li>
                <li>We do not track which specific apps you block or when you use them.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>To provide the app's core features entirely on your device (screen time tracking, streaks, and tree growth).</li>
                <li>To display your streak count, total blocked apps count, and last active time to friends you've connected with (only if you use the friends feature).</li>
                <li>We do not use your data for advertising, analytics, or any other purpose.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>All data is stored locally on your device.</li>
                <li>If you use the friends feature, only your streak count, total apps count, and last active time are uploaded to our servers solely for the purpose of showing this information to your friends.</li>
                <li>We never sell, share, analyze, or use your data for any purpose other than displaying it to friends you've chosen to connect with.</li>
                <li>We do not share your information with third parties.</li>
