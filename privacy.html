        <h2>Privacy Policy for Little Trees: Screen Time</h2>
        <section>
            <p><strong>Effective Date: October 2025</strong></p>

            <p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how Little Trees: Screen Time handles your information.</p>

            <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
            <p><strong>We do not collect, store, or analyze your personal data.</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local storage only:</strong> All app usage data (streaks, blocked app settings, progress, and tree growth) is stored entirely on your device. We never have access to this information.</li>
                <li><strong>Friends feature (optional):</strong> If you choose to add friends, only your current streak count, total number of apps blocked, and last active time are uploaded to enable the friends leaderboard feature. This minimal data is only used to display your progress to friends you've connected with.</li>
                <li>We do not collect personal information such as your name, address, email, or any other identifying details.</li>
                <li>We do not track which specific apps you block or when you use them.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How We Use Information</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>To provide the app's core features entirely on your device (screen time tracking, streaks, and tree growth).</li>
                <li>To display your streak count, total blocked apps count, and last active time to friends you've connected with (only if you use the friends feature).</li>
                <li>We do not use your data for advertising, analytics, or any other purpose.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Data Storage and Sharing</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>All data is stored locally on your device.</li>
                <li>If you use the friends feature, only your streak count, total apps count, and last active time are uploaded to our servers solely for the purpose of showing this information to your friends.</li>
                <li>We never sell, share, analyze, or use your data for any purpose other than displaying it to friends you've chosen to connect with.</li>
                <li>We do not share your information with third parties.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>

                <li>We do not use any analytics, tracking, or advertising services.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Screen Time API</h3>

                <li>All Screen Time data is processed entirely on your device.</li>
                <li>Screen Time data is NEVER uploaded to our servers.</li>
                <li>We only use this data locally to display your progress, maintain your streaks, and grow your virtual tree.</li>
                <li>We do not know which specific apps you block or when you use them.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Data Retention and Deletion</h3>
